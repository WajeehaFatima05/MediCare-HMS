## OOP Concepts Implemented

-  **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with property decorators
-  **Inheritance**: Person base class extended by Patient and Doctor
-  **Polymorphism**: Overridden display methods
-  **Abstraction**: Clean, modular interfaces
-  **Data Persistence**: JSON-based storage system

##  Data Storage

All data is automatically saved to `hospital_data.json` file and persists between sessions.
