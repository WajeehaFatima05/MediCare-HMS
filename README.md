## 🎯 OOP Concepts Implemented

- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with property decorators
- ✅ **Inheritance**: Person base class extended by Patient and Doctor
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: Overridden display methods
- ✅ **Abstraction**: Clean, modular interfaces
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: JSON-based storage system

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is automatically saved to `hospital_data.json` file and persists between sessions.
